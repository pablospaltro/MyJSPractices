// CALCULATING A CIRCLE'S CIRCUMFERENCE

// const = a variable that can't be changed

//Circle circumference : 2*Pi*r

//"const" prevents a variable from being changed later on

//SOME MATH METHODS:

// Math
//Rounding a number:

let x = -2.7;
let y = 5;
let z = 9;
let maximum;
let minimum;

//round:
//x = Math.round(x);

//round down:
//x = Math.floor(x);

//round up:
//x = Math.ceil(x);

//x to the power of:
//Math.pow(base, exponent)
//x= Math.pow(x, 2);

//square root:
//x = Math.sqrt(x);

//absolute value:
//x = Math.abs(x);

//maximum = Math.max(x, y, z);
//minimum = Math.min(x, y, z);

x = Math.PI;

console.log(x);
//console.log(maximum);
//console.log(minimum);
